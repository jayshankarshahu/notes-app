DO THINGS IN THE ORDER THEY ARE WRITTEN

Version 1

- Everytime the home page appears it should fetch from sqlite 

- The edit page should expect an id of the note as a parameter and should fetch the rest of the info from sqlite

- If it's a new note it should send blank and it will insert and then keep updating the note

- Implement debouncing for it
 
- In the home page there should be 

    - search option

    - option to sort by either 
    
        - createdAt ( asc and desc ), 
        - editedAt ( asc and desc ) [ default ]

    - and also a pull down to refresh gesture

    - Editing notes should have undo redo button

# should be ready ON OR BEFORE 1st AUGUST

Version 2

- add tags in the notes

- search using tags ( # ) and also add chips to filter using tags

- add/remove/"mark as done" reminders on notes
